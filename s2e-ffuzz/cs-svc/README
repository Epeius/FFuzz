Constraint Solving Service
==========================

The service provides a wrapper over the Z3's built-in shell.
Accepts SMTLIBv2 commands.

Initialization
--------------

Upon connection, the client must initialize the solver session
by using either one of these two commands:

   command:
   (get-new-session)

   reply:
   new session id

or

   command:
   (set-new-session id)
   
   reply:
   id

set-new-session takes as parameter an id that was obtained by a prior
call to get-new-session.

Sessions allow to close/open connections to the service without
losing the Z3 state. When the client drops its connection to the service,
the service will keep Z3 open for a while.

Commands
--------

After initialization, the client can send any commands accepted by Z3.

The typical command is (check-sat), which returns sat or unsat depending
on the satisfiability of the current set of constraints.

Another command is (get-value), which returns the concrete value for
a given expression. The service intercepts this command and formats
the reply so that clients can parse it more easily.

  command:
  (get-value ...)

  reply:
  variable_name index concrete_byte

Issuing (exit) will terminate the solver instance.
