S2E Selective Symbolic Execution Framework
Virtual Machine Introspection Library
=============================================================

This library allows easy inspection of VM's state by exposing
as much debug information as possible. Debug information can
come from the guest VM itself, compiled binaries with debug
information, etc.

libvmi relies on libdwarf to do the actual debug info parsing.

libvmi can be used by S2E plugins.
