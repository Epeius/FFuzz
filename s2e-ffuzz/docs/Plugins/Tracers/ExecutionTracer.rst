ExecutionTracer
===============

The ExecutionTracer plugin is the main tracing plugin.
This plugin saves a binary trace file in the ``s2e-last/ExecutionTracer.dat`` file.
This file is composed of generic trace items. Each item can have an arbitrary format, determined by the various client tracing plugins.
The client plugins call the ExecutionTracer's API to write trace items.

By default, ExecutionTracer records the program counters where fork occurs.
This allows offline analysis tools to rebuild the execution tree and provide per-path analyses.
